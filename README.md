I trained RL agents in Godot and made them play volleyball.

This contains a lot of the code from the example environment by Godot RL Agents, I used their assets as well. About all I changed is a little bit with the observations and actions like better number of raycast sensors to improve training and also I added more envs that train in parallel.
